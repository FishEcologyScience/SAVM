\item{dat}{{\code{data.frame}}\cr{} A \code{data.frame} containing some or all of the
following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{depth_m}: Numeric, depth in meters.
\item \code{fetch_km}: Numeric, fetch in kilometers.
\item \code{secchi}: Numeric Secchi depth (post_hoc)
\item \code{substrate}: Binary (0 = absent, 1 = present), indicating substrate
limitations. (post_hoc)
\item \code{limitation}: Binary (0 = absent, 1 = present), indicating user-supplied
limitations.

\item{type}{{\verb{character vector}, either \code{"cover"} or \code{"pa"}}\cr{}
Model type(s).}

\item{depth, fetch, substrate, secchi, limitation}{Column specification, see details.}

\item{vmax_par}{{\verb{named list}}\cr{} intercept and slope of the equation from
Chambers and Kalff (1985) to compute the maximum depth of plant colonization
(Vmax). Default values taken from model A in Croft-White et al. (2022). See
section details for more details.}

\value{
A data frame object with input columns and predictions: \code{Cover} if \code{type}=
and/or \code{PA} depending
on \code{type}

\description{
Load Random Forest models for SAV cover and presence absence.
}
\details{
There are two sets of models available. The first set consists of models
predicting the presence or absence of SAV, while the second set focuses on
SAV cover. Each set includes three random forest models: one using depth as
a predictor, another using fetch, and a third combining both variables. For
further details, see Croft-White (2022).

The selected model for generating predictions is determined by the type
argument, which specifies the output as either cover or presence-absence,
depending on the available predictors. The required input variables—depth,
fetch, substrate, secchi, limitation—must correspond to column names in
\code{dat}; otherwise, an error is thrown. If neither 'depth' nor 'fetch' is
explicitly provided, the function will attempt to infer them from the column
names. Matching is case-insensitive and will detect 'depth_m', 'depth',
'fetch_km' and 'fetch'.

If \code{secchi} is present, then a column \code{vmax} is returned that includes the
maximum depth of plant colonization that can be used in post-hoc with de
