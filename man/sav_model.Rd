\description{
Load Random Forest models for SAV cover and presence absence.
}
\details{
There are two sets of models available. The first set consists of models
predicting the presence or absence of SAV, while the second set focuses on
SAV cover. Each set includes three random forest models: one using depth as
a predictor, another using fetch, and a third combining both variables. For
further details, see Croft-White (2022).

The selected model for generating predictions is determined by the type
argument, which specifies the output as either cover or presence-absence,
depending on the available predictors. The required input variables—depth,
fetch, substrate, and secchi—must correspond to column names in d_inputs;
otherwise, an error is thrown. If neither depth nor fetch is explicitly
provided, the function will attempt to infer them from the column names.
Matching is case-insensitive but must be exact.
