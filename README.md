[![R CMD Check](https://github.com/inSilecoInc/SAVM/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/inSilecoInc/SAVM/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)


## Background

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is responsible for the management of aquatic freshwater habitat and the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program is seeking tools that can help in their decision support process. The Fish Ecology Science Lab at DFO has developed general models to predict the presence and cover of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Laurentian Great Lakes (Croft-White et al. 2022). SAV is a critical component of fish habitat that is frequently affected by in-water works or habitat improvement initiatives. Croft-White et al. (2022) outlines the completed SAV model and how an  R-package and  web-application tool could be created and utilized. DFO GLLFAS does not have the capacity to create the necessary R package and requires the services of a contractor to advance these works. A key aspect of package development will be ensuring further tool development within DFO can follow similar methods so tools can be integrated or, at a minimum, contain input or outputs that can be moved among tools
